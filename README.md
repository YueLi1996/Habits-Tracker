## Overview
### Description
An app that keeps track of your habits. A habit could be a task you want to have reminders for so that you do it daily or x amount of times. A thing like drinking water or taking breaks at certain times.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile however it could be equally used on a computer. The functionality could be shared between the mobile and computer devices.
- **Story:** A user creates a few habits they want to keep track of which the app will remind and enables the user to keep updating the records of doing the habit and repeats for x number of days chosen by the user.
- **Market:** Any individual can choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as daily as the user wants depending on their use cases.
- **Scope:** First get started by having the user be able to track a habit through daily reminders based on the userâ€™s preferences. Then having them be able to input more habits which could then be paired into sections of habits to notify them all at once instead of individually.
